Minilyzer

Minilyzer is a Windows shell script that uses Microsoft's Debugging Tools for
Windows to analyze the Minidump files that are created when a BSOD occurs and
generate a report detailing the event. Full memory dumps (C:\Windows\Memory.dmp)
can also be analyzed.

Usage:
  1. Run minilyzer.cmd. It will attempt to analyze the newest DMP file in %WinDir%\Minidump.
  2. Drag and drop a Minidump file onto the script.
  3. From a command prompt, type e.g.: minilyzer.cmd "C:\Windows\Minidump\Mini012309-01.dmp".
  4. Change the minidump_file variable in the script, then run it.
